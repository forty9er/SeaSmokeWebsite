            <p>Sea Smoke Roadside BBQ was founded in 2012 by owner (and BBQ enthusiast) Chris McClintock.  Inspired by his time spent in California&#39;s beautiful Central Coast region, Chris learned the art and science of winemaking and its harmonious relationship with great food.  It was here that Chris was introduced to a discipline of BBQ known as <em>Santa Maria Style</em>.  Santa Maria BBQ bursts with flavor as the meat is seasoned and cooked to perfection over hot oak coals- locally sourced.  Combined with the Pit Master&#39;s special blend of herbs and spices, <em>Santa Maria Style</em> brings out exceptional flavor from oysters, chicken, pork, and most famously, tri-tip.</p>
            <p>Now, for almost a decade, Chris has brought his vision of the great <em>Santa Maria BBQ Style</em> to the Jersey Shore and patrons from all over the globe. Customers can choose from 3 seating options: dining room tables, bar side (limited menu), and patio seating (shade and heaters provided).  Check out our seasonal menu located on our <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>.</p>
                
            <h3>Community Outreach</h3>
            
            <p>Alongside the vision of great BBQ, Sea Smoke Roadside also strives to use its resources for positive community outreach.  Chris and the Sea Smoke management work closely with the local artists, activists, policy makers, and schools/sports teams.  With special events planned every month, Sea Smoke is a beacon for forum and fundraising.  Refer to our Special Events page for more details.</p>
